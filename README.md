In this project, I developed machine learning models using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to predict diabetes based on patient data. I trained both models, compared their performance using evaluation metrics, and selected the best one. I then created a user-friendly Streamlit application where users can input patient information and get diabetes prediction results. The app also visualizes the patient's data compared to the training dataset to provide better insights. Finally, I deployed the application using Streamlit, making it accessible through a simple web interface.
